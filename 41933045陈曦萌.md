*Failure as feedback*
## History of Computing##
**From Abacus to Analytical Engine**

one of the earliest known computers was invented in 500BC

Blaise Pascal:perform calculations for user automatically

Joseph Jacqurd:programmable loom, hole and hook

Charles Babbage:analytical engine

Ada Lovelace:developed the first *algorithm* for engine

**The Path to Modern Computers**

*Cryptography*: The art of writing and soving codes

Alan Turing

magenetic tape:1970s and 80s

ENIAC:one of the earliest forms of general-purpose computers

Adimral Grace:the first compiler

Xerox Alto:the first computer that resembled the computers we see nowadays

Steve Jobs

IBM:1980s, personal computer

*Open source*:Anyone could modify and share it
## Digital Logic##
**Computer Language**

*Binary system*:The communication that a computer uses, also known as a base-2 numeral system

**Character Encoding**

*Character encoding*:Assigns our binary values to characters, so that we as humans can read them

**Binary**

*Logic gates*:Allow or transistors to do more complex tasks, like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions

**How to Count in Binary**

**Abstraction**

*Abstraction*:To take a relatively complex system and simplify for our use
